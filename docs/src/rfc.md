# RFCs

This chapter contains some RFCs (Request for Comments). Since not too many
people cooperated in this project they are held relatively light-weight and may
not be equivalent RFCs as you know from other projects.

A template can be found in the source of this documentation under
`docs/src/rfc/0-template.md`. All RFCs are meant to give introspect as to why we
should modify certain behavior and which drawbacks and limitations this change
implies.
